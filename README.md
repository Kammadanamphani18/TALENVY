2. Upload to project's `/docs/images` folder
3. Update image URLs in this README


<think>Let me analyze the provided code and create a comprehensive README file for the stock dashboard application. The codebase appears to be a stock market data visualization application built with Python, using Dash, Plotly, and other libraries.

The main components of the application are:
1. `large_stock_data_fetcher.py` - A script that fetches historical stock data using yfinance and saves it to a CSV file
2. `stock_dashboard.py` - A Dash application that provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing the stock data

I notice several image files are mentioned in the question, which are likely visualization outputs from the dashboard, but I don't have access to the content of these files. I'll mention them in the README as example outputs.

The README should include:
- Project overview and purpose
- Features
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions
- Dependencies
- Example screenshots (based on the file names)
- Explanation of components
- How to customize</think>

```

## Usage

### 1. Fetch Stock Data
First, run the data fetcher script to download historical stock data:

```bash
python large_stock_data_fetcher.py
```

This script will:
- Download data for 10 major stocks from 2015 to 2024
- Save the data to `large_stock_dataset_2015_2024.csv`

### 2. Launch the Dashboard
After generating the dataset, start the interactive dashboard:

```bash
python stock_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.

### 3. Using the Dashboard
- **Select Stocks**: Choose one or more stocks from the dropdown menu
- **Date Range**: Set your preferred time period using the date picker
- **Chart Type**: Switch between price, returns, and volume visualizations
- **Technical Indicators**: Add moving averages and RSI as needed
- **Performance Analysis**: View key metrics for each selected stock at the bottom of the dashboard

## Components

### Data Fetcher (`large_stock_data_fetcher.py`)
- Uses `yfinance` to download historical stock data
- Processes and combines data from multiple tickers
- Saves the combined dataset as a CSV file

### Dashboard Application (`stock_dashboard.py`)
- Built with Dash and Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Calculates additional metrics like moving averages, RSI, and performance statistics
- Provides an intuitive user interface with multiple visualization options

## Customization
- To add more stocks: Edit the `tickers` list in `large_stock_data_fetcher.py`
- To change the date range: Modify `start_date` and `end_date` in `large_stock_data_fetcher.py`
- To add new technical indicators: Extend the `calculate_metrics` function in `stock_dashboard.py`
