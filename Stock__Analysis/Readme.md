<think>Let me analyze the provided code and create a comprehensive README file for the stock dashboard application. The codebase appears to be a stock market data visualization application built with Python, using Dash, Plotly, and other libraries.

The main components of the application are:
1. `large_stock_data_fetcher.py` - A script that fetches historical stock data using yfinance and saves it to a CSV file
2. `stock_dashboard.py` - A Dash application that provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing the stock data

I notice several image files are mentioned in the question, which are likely visualization outputs from the dashboard, but I don't have access to the content of these files. I'll mention them in the README as example outputs.

The README should include:
- Project overview and purpose
- Features
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions
- Dependencies
- Example screenshots (based on the file names)
- Explanation of components
- How to customize</think>
# Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive stock market dashboard application built with Python, allowing users to visualize and analyze historical stock data for multiple companies from 2015 to 2024.

## Features
- **Interactive Stock Selection**: Analyze up to 10 major tech and financial company stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX)
- **Customizable Date Range**: Filter data by specific time periods
- **Multiple Chart Types**: View price movements, daily returns, or trading volume
- **Technical Indicators**: Add moving averages (20-day, 50-day) and RSI to your analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Track total returns, average daily returns, volatility, and maximum drawdown
- **Volume Analysis**: Examine trading volume patterns and trends

## Screenshots
The `Reports` directory contains example visualizations:
- Stock price charts
- Returns analysis
- Volume comparison
- Technical indicator overlays

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
cd stock-market-analysis
```

2. Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install dash dash-bootstrap-components plotly pandas yfinance numpy
```

## Usage

### 1. Fetch Stock Data
First, run the data fetcher script to download historical stock data:

```bash
python large_stock_data_fetcher.py
```

This script will:
- Download data for 10 major stocks from 2015 to 2024
- Save the data to `large_stock_dataset_2015_2024.csv`

### 2. Launch the Dashboard
After generating the dataset, start the interactive dashboard:

```bash
python stock_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.

### 3. Using the Dashboard
- **Select Stocks**: Choose one or more stocks from the dropdown menu
- **Date Range**: Set your preferred time period using the date picker
- **Chart Type**: Switch between price, returns, and volume visualizations
- **Technical Indicators**: Add moving averages and RSI as needed
- **Performance Analysis**: View key metrics for each selected stock at the bottom of the dashboard

## Components

### Data Fetcher (`large_stock_data_fetcher.py`)
- Uses `yfinance` to download historical stock data
- Processes and combines data from multiple tickers
- Saves the combined dataset as a CSV file

### Dashboard Application (`stock_dashboard.py`)
- Built with Dash and Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Calculates additional metrics like moving averages, RSI, and performance statistics
- Provides an intuitive user interface with multiple visualization options

## Customization
- To add more stocks: Edit the `tickers` list in `large_stock_data_fetcher.py`
- To change the date range: Modify `start_date` and `end_date` in `large_stock_data_fetcher.py`
- To add new technical indicators: Extend the `calculate_metrics` function in `stock_dashboard.py`
